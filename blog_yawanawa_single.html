            <p>So here I am in an Internet cafe in Tauraucá, a small city in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. The last days have been really special… I came here to visit the Yawanawa Indians, my spiritual family, and my maestro: Don Luis. Maybe i start to write how I met him, how I came to the Yawanawa’s. So you have an impression how this all happened.</p>
            <p>In July 2013 i moved from Amsterdam to follow a vision that came to me, to open up a center for healing: Sananda-Wasi. After my arrival in Pisac, I went immediately to Brazil to pick up the medicine of the Santo Daime to be used in the center I was opening. I just had a very moving time in the Netherlands: closing down my life as a classical musician, giving up my apartment in Amsterdam, finishing my relationship and left my friends and family to go to Peru. To follow a vision from which i didn’t know what it would bring me.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="img/tmp/blog_yawanawa_single.jpg" alt="blog">
          </div>
          <div class="content-block">
            <p>The path of setting up the center was guided in pure synchronicity. It was a beautiful path, and that path really helped me to trust all the things that were in front of me, to trust to leave all things behind, to simply trust this new period in my life. Still it had not been an easy period in my life… So many changes came up, so many people were questioning my steps.</p>
        <p>Arriving in Brazil, in Rio Branco, I picked up the Santo Daime. At that point I felt I could not just go back to Pisac to start the work. Somewhere I knew that a period was coming up of hard work. And now looking back, my intuition was right: I worked the last 17 months many hours every day, without almost any breaks, in full concentration.</p>
              <p>So in Rio Branco I decided to take a break, a nice holiday before starting the work. I had no clue what to do, so I started to walk randomly through the city.</p>
              <p>In the ceremonies I had done before coming to South America I received 2 clear messages: “Cruzeiro do Sul” and “Yawanawa”. I kind of forgot about Cruzeiro do Sul, as I knew it was a city in Brazil, and I had no clue what Yawanawa was… I tried to google it, but did not know the right way to spell it, resulting in not finding anything.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="img/tmp/blog_yawanawa_single02.jpg" alt="blog">
            <div class="desc"><span>There I was walking and I saw a sign</span></div>
          </div>
          <div class="content-block">
            <p>OK! That is were I am going. I left most of my stuff at the Santo Daime community and jumped in a plane to Cruzeiro do Sul. I was amazing to fly above the mighty Amazon… This were the lungs of the planet, the place were there was a remedy found for every dis-ease, the place that was the pharmacy of our planet. I was amazed to see it from above; it looked very pristine, not yet touched so much by western society. I was very exited… No clue what this would bring me, a deep feeling of grace was coming in.</p>
            <p>I arrived at the airport and stood there: what the hell was I doing here… I had no lonely Planet (my favorite company on all my other trips), and no idea what to do.</p>
            <p>There was a guy standing around that   I felt called to. I went to him and told him that I just had jumped on the plane, without a clue what I was doing there, I had the feeling that he could help me.</p>
            <p>He was a western man, and he explained me that he was a professor on the university close by. He asked me if I wanted to go to the santo  Daime communities, I answered that I was not so interested in that, as I was working already with the Santo Daime for a while. Would I be interested in visiting indigenous communities?</p>
            <p>WOW! That sounded amazing, yes that is what I wanted.</p>
            <p>There was a guy standing next to him, he put me in a car with that guy and there I was; driving with a guy whose language I couldn’t understand, going to an unknown place.</p>
            <p>After 4 hours we arrived at a small town next to a mighty river, Sao Vicente. He kind of explained me that this river was going deep into the Amazon Rainforest. There was a boat just leaving, a couple of indigenous people on it. I shouted to them to come back, they came back and I asked if I could go with them. They agreed and I stepped into the boat. They did not spoke any Portuguese, any English, there was no way i could talk to them…</p>
            <p>After 5 minutes my mind kicked in: what the hell was I doing? I had no water, no food, I had no clue what I was doing, where I was going… I decided to surrender to whatever was in front of me. I was on a holiday! And as on most of my travels, I always just followed what was coming up. I decided to surrender to all what would be in front of me.</p>
            <p>I was siting in the front of the boat, and I felt all the last months slip of my shoulders, almost like my “old” life was floating </p>

          <div class="content-block">
            <p>t was already getting dark and we slept on the shore of the river in a hammock. Next morning we continued. A couple of hours later we arrived in a village: Mutum, one of the main Villages of the Yawanawa Indians.</p>
            <p>WOW!! Here i was… That was the message from the ceremonies: Yawanawa.</p>
            <p>I could hardly believe this was happening. A wave of energy raged through my body.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">

          </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>There was a festival going on: the mariri Festival. It happens once a year, and all the Yawanawa’s get together. They dance, they sing, they do their ceremonies with their sacred medicines, they show their art, their music. It was all amazing to see… The woman were dressed in short skirts made from dried leaves, the rest of their bodies naked, painted with red paint, like warriors, dancing in big circles.</p>
          <p>At that time I was not drinking Ayahuasca for a few months. Even in the ceremonies I was leading, I was not drinking. I was slowly learning to get to the same level of consciousness without drinking, connecting with Madre Ayahuasca in the astral. So in the ceremonies with the Yawanawa I was present, but I did not drink their Huni; the name they gave to the sacred medicine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>After 2 days I felt that I had not come for a festival, and as much as I enjoyed it, I felt I came for something else. I decided to leave the crowd and to walk into the forest. It was so beautiful to be in the forest again… Hearing the symphonies of the insects, the arias of the birds. So beautiful! I started to walk and follow the paths, returning after a while so not to get lost.</p>
          <p>I came to a center where people would come to do dietas. Dietas are old ways to work with very powerful plants; master plants. It can take anything from a couple of days until a year. Following a strict diet, being mostly in soltitude, you ingest one of the master plants. There can be many benefits of such dietas, and more and more western people find their way to the amazon to do a dieta. The ancient ways of using the plants are slowly going into the world, to help us to heal, to awaken, to take the next step in humanity.
          <p>I walked around, talked with some people. It felt strange… In a way very touristy. There were people following their 15th dieta, this one being the last one before becoming a master shaman. I looked at him, had my question marks and left.</p>
          <p>In one of the ceremonies before I had seen a man in my visions. I had felt immediately his wisdom and power. He was standing high in the sky looking down at me, i bowed to him in my vision. He was a man with only one arm; his left arm was cut of.</p>
          <p>Then on the way back it happened: i met him…</p>
          <p>A man with one arm, standing in the forest. I looked at him, and felt a rush of energy going up my spine… Who was this man?? I felt humbled, I felt his connection to the plants, his connection to spirit, to the creator. I could not stop looking at him.</p>
          <p>I went to him and started to speak. I spoke kind of Spanish and he spoke Portuguese. I asked him if we could walk back to the village and find somebody to translate. He knodded and started to walk back. I walked next to him.</p>
          <p>He was walking in silence, I felt his connection while walking, it was so beautiful to feel him. Sometimes he would stop and point something out to me: a bird, a plant, a tree.  But there were no words exchanged.</p>
          <p>We arrived back in Mutum and soon I had found somebody willing to translate. We sat down and started to talk.</p>
          <p>He asked me who I was. I explained him that I came from the Netherlands, that I just moved to Peru to open a center. A center for healing, to work with the plants, with diet, with natural medicines and healing. I explained him a bit more about the program, he just nodded and listened. He asked me if I worked with the sacred medicines. I told him that I was holding ceremonies with ayahuasca, I explained him the way I was working; small groups, lots of attention, healing inside of the ceremony. I also told him that I was not drinking at that moment. That I saw ayahuasca as a teacher, and that, as every good teacher in my life, I would like to go at one point on my own feet, without the teacher. I also told him that I had not spoken to many people about it, as I was still a bit insecure about it. The few people I had spoken about it, were quite skeptical; what? You work with the medicine, but don’t drink it?</p>
