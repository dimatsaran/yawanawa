          <h4>Testimonials</h4>
          <p><q>This ceremony with Dennis was in the top 3 ceremonies I've experienced in my life.</q></p>
          <p><cite>Dennis McKenna, PhD</cite></p>
          <p><q>The vibration you disperse, the purity and discipline brought to your retreats, the energies and dynamics triggered, the esthetics, both acoustically and visually, make for an incomparable experience! I am so proud of you, and hope you are too of yourselves. The authenticity and roots approach into it, the mastery and vibration, the intensity and peace you bring… wow.</q></p>
          <p><cite>Menno</cite></p>
          <p><q>There are no words to express my deep deep deep gratitude for allowing me to go through such a process... The sacred space you created was a womb where one felt safe to be reborn... All I can do now is live up to what was given to me. Thank you for taking the time to talk and listen before and after the Journey - it was very much appreciated! You are truly a beacon of Light and it was pure joy to meet you and experience the love you share for each other and for the rest of humankind.</q></p>

        <h2><b>Dennis Notten,</b><br>M. A.</h2>
        <p><b>Dennis Notten is the spiritual guide and founder of SacredJourney.Earth. He is a certified KRI Kundalini Yoga and Meditation teacher, a Theta Healer, a Reiki Master, and had several years of experience of running his own healing centre in the Sacred Valley of the Incas in Peru.</b></p>
        <p>Before committing to the path of healing, Dennis was a professional bassoonist in some of the world’s leading orchestras; he uses his musical gifts in the ceremonial setting, working with sounds as an energy healing modality.</p>
        <p>For the past four years he has been learning from and working with the Yawanawá tribe in the Brazilian Amazon. Padrinho Alfredo, the spiritual leader of the Santo Daime, granted Dennis the blessing to work with the medicine of the Santo Daime in his personal work. He is uniquely suited to bridge the gap between Indigenous people and the West, as he is a Westerner who has spent extensive time in the Amazon learning from Indigenous leaders, and his work transcends such boundaries.</p>
